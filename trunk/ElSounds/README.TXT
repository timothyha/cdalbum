                         ELDOS SOUNDS 1.0 release

      1. WHAT'S ELDOS SOUNDS?

    EldoS Sounds is the freeware collection of decoders for different sound
formats and supplementary components. EldoS Sounds started its  life  as  a
continuation of MPegPlay project. Currently only one decoder for Audio MPEG
is available. But the open scheme of EldoS Sounds allows different decoders
to be developed and used. You can plug these decoders to  your  program  in
run-time.

      2. IS ELDOS SOUNDS REALLY FREE?

    Yes. It is freeware, under the terms of the license, included  in  this 
package.

      3. HOW DO I INSTALL ELDOS SOUNDS?

   As with any component, you use Component|Install Component command  from
Delphi IDE menu.

      4. HOW DO I USE ELDOS SOUNDS?

   The help file is included in this package. 
      
      5. HOW IS ELDOS SOUNDS RELATED TO OPEN-SOURCE CONCEPT?

   It is related :). EldoS needs help with EldoS Sounds  development.  Your  
suggestions, bug-fixes, improvements and support are welcome. Everyone  may 
request the source code for the modules, made by EldoS (please, explain the
reason). 

      6. WHO'S GUILTY?

   Good question. The Delphi component itself is the  creature  constructed
by me, Eugene Mayevski. 

   Windows Media Audio interface module is written by Eugene Mayevski.

   Windows Media Audio decoder core is the property of Microsoft.


   The history of ElAMP, MPEG decoder module used in EldoS Sounds is long ... 

   The ISO MPEG Audio Subgroup Software Simulation Group wrote the public C
code for a MPEG Audio decoder, and the  layer  III code of maplay for Win32
was adapted from here.

   Tobias Bading (bading@cs.tu-berlin.de) wrote the original maplay  source
for UNIX. 

   Jeff Tsay (ctsay@pasteur.eecs.berkeley.edu) ported the  original  maplay
to Win32, wrote the interface code and adapted and optimized the layer  III
code from the public c code.

   Me, Eugene Mayevski, made MPegPlay 1.x, which was based on maplay 1.20. 

   Stephan Koenig (Thunderboy@gmx.net) helped a bit to  make  MPegPlay  1.x
(mainly error fixes).     

   While working on commercial ActiveMP control, Stephan Koenig and  I,  we
both improved audio subsystem (it was a total nightmare; WinMM is a heap of
shit!) and streaming. 

   Stephan Koenig decided to change the decoder core and changed it :).  He
took  Michael  Hipp's (hippm@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de) mpeg123  core.

   !!!!!!!!!!! BIG THANKS TO MICHAEL HIPP FOR THE PERFECT DECODER !!!!!!!!!

   The rest of the code with some  modifications  came  from  ActiveMP  and
MPegPlay 1.x. 

   After Stephan Koenig had disappeared and no  releases  of  MPegPlay  2.0
were avaiable, I decided to take the code assembled by Stephan  Koenig  and
release MPegPlay 2.0. But, well, modifications of this code were big enough
to start a new product. You know the rest ...
