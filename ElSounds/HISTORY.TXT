-- 25 Nov 1999. bug-fix 2 (v1.07). 

ElAMP, WAVMP:

* changing playback position greatly improved.

-- 3 Aug 1999. bug-fix 1 (v1.06).

Component:

+ Callbacks handling improved. 

ElAMP:

* Fixed the "bug" when the execution halted on some lsf streams.
* fixed the bug when restarting playback after wav output.

-- 28 July 1999. Version 1.0 Release

All modules:

! OnOutput event is invoked twice per buffer - first time, when the buffer 
  is sent to mmSystem, and second time when the buffer is returned by mmSystem

* OnOutput* events are invoked for all output modes, and in correct order.
* Some memory leaks removed


ElAMP:

* Fixed the bug, that caused an error with large buffers
* Fixed(?) the bug when only half of some VBR streams is played.

-- 30 June 1999. Version 1.0 beta 6 (pre-release)

Component:

! Changed the declaration of OnInputSeek event. Now the event handler 
  SHOULD return the current position in the stream (this is used to
  prevent players from stopping when seeking VBR streams).

All modules:

* Fixed(?) the bug with some strange PCI cards, when the player crashed
  after the playback stop. 
* Fixed the bug that prevented the module from initializing when OLE system
  was already initialized before the module is loaded.

ElAMP:

* Fixed the bug with files, that have ID3v2 header.
! Now 48KHz streams are downsampled to 24KHz when being played to MMSystem
  (not downsampled when being played to other output). Say thanks to Billy :(.
  This allows the module to play 48KHz to MMSystem (in earlier betas it was
  not possible to play these files at all).

// BUGS:

- custom downsampling (for ex. 48000 to 44100) doesn't work. If someone helps
  me to fix the bug, or rewrites this downsampling at all, it would be so cool.
                                                                 

-- 18 Jun 1999. Version 1.0 beta 5

ElAMP:

* VBR streams are played fine
* streams made with AudioCatalyst are played fine
* streams with RIFF header are almost always played fine (see bugs section).

// BUGS:
- on some computers RIFF-headered files are not played. On my computer these
  exact streams are played fine. So if anyone will experience this problem,
  please, help me to fix the bug.

WMAMP:

* EndPos processing fixed (actually it is made working)




-- 10 Jun 1999. Version 1.0 beta 4

+ Windows Media Audio module added.

Component:

* Volume control improved.
* Equalizer support added.

ElAMP:

+ Equalizer support made public.
+ DirectSound support added.
* Output callback processing improved.
                      



-- 2 Jun 1999. Version 1.0 beta 3

Component: 

* both input and output callbacks fixed

ElAMP:
  
* callbacks fixed
